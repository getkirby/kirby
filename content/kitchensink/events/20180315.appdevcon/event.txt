Text: Appdevcon is a conference by app developers, for app developers. We have two days with multiple tracks, designed in such a way that whether you’re an Android, iOS, Windows, Web, TV or other app developer, there’s always at least one session that should be of interest. The venue is great, it’s the Pathé Arena Multiplex Movie Theater in Amsterdam. We expect around 300 attendees.
