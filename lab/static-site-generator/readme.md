# Kirby Lab / Static Site Generator

Kirby is often mixed up with static site generators. While it is much more powerful than that, it can be converted into one. This is great if you prefer to host your site on a service like Netlify or Github Pages.

Either load the index.php in your browser or call it from the CLI with `php index.php` to generate the static files.

This script is just a demo and not a full-blown generator. It can be extended rather easily though.
