We are really happy about any help with our translations. Please, do not translate directly in the JSON files though. We use a service called Transifex to handle all languages for the Panel: https://www.transifex.com/getkirby/panel/ Create an account there and send us a request to join our translator group. Please, also send us an email at <support@getkirby.com>. Unfortunately, we don't get notified properly about new translator requests and often miss them.
